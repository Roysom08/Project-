# Project-
I’m working on a project for a chat app where users can send messages to each other. I’m using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. I’ve already implemented the sign-up and login functions, but I’m stuck on the chat page where users can be displayed and messages can be sent. Could someone please help me with this? I’m a student.
